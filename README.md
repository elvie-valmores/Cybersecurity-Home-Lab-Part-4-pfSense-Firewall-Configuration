# Cybersecurity Home Lab Part 4: pfSense Firewall Configuration

## Objectives
In this module, the objective was to install and configure the pfSense firewall in VirtualBox. The pfSense firewall will establish a secure, segmented network topology for the home lab, allowing for effective management and monitoring of network traffic, as well as interaction with other systems like Kali Linux and vulnerable machines in later modules.

### Skills Learned
- Downloading and installing pfSense in a virtual machine.
- Configuring network interfaces and assigning appropriate IP addresses.
- Setting up firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- Implementing Network Address Translation (NAT) for internal network devices.
- Establishing Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections for secure remote access.
- Monitoring network activity and logs to identify potential security issues.
- Troubleshooting network connectivity problems within the virtual lab environment.
